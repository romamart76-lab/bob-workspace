## Key Findings Summary

### Demand Validation: ✅ STRONG

1. **Proven Market:** 70K users on Kleo alone, 10+ competing extensions
2. **Active Search:** 9K-22K monthly searches for LinkedIn formatting
3. **Willingness to Pay:** Users converting from free to $8-30/month tools
4. **Growing Trend:** LinkedIn creator economy expanding
5. **Clear Gap:** No polished formatter in $7-12 range

### User Language Patterns

**What users say they want:**
- "Simple" (5+ mentions)
- "Reliable" / "No bugs" (implied by free tool complaints)
- "Easy to use" (8+ mentions)
- "Just copy/paste" (frictionless)
- "Affordable price" (price-conscious)

**What users DON'T want:**
- Complex platforms (scheduling, analytics)
- Feature bloat ("too many features I don't use")
- Credit systems (confusing)
- Expensive ($30+ unless clear ROI)

### Pricing Strategy

**Recommended: $7.99/month or $79/year**

**Rationale:**
- Below psychological $10 barrier
- Above "too cheap to trust" ($5)
- 17% annual discount drives conversions
- Competitive gap (free to $16+)
- ROI: Saves 10 min/week = $8/mo justified

### Feature Priorities

**Must-Have (MVP):**
1. Text formatting (15+ styles)
2. Live preview (desktop + mobile)
3. Templates (15-20 curated)
4. Character counter
5. Chrome extension

**Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP):**
- Markdown support
- Snippet library
- Multi-platform (X, Threads, Facebook)

**Do NOT Build:**
- Scheduling (scope creep)
- AI generation (different product)
- Analytics (bloat)
- Team features (enterprise complexity)
